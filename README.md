# A guide to modeling mesoscale membrane deformations with coarse-grained computer simulations

This repository contains ready-to-run tutorials on the simulation tests presented in the membrane review by B. Meadowcroft, F. Frey, M. Mu√±oz-Basagoiti, A. Prada and M. Amaral.

## Three-beads-per-lipid membrane: Cooke model
Please add info needed to understand and run your tutorial(s).

## One-particle thick fluid membrane: YLZ model
Please add info needed to understand and run your tutorial(s).

## Dynamically triangulated membrane model: TriLMP
We use TriLMP to simulate a fluid membrane using a Dynamically Triangulated Network (DTN). TriLMP is a modified version of the Trimem python package(https://github.com/bio-phys/trimem). To be able to run the tutorials of this section, you will have to install TriLMP. For that, please go to the [TriLMP Github repository](https://github.com/Saric-Group/trimem_sbeady) and follow the installation guide for your operating system.
