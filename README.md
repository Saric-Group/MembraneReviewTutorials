## Tutorials <a name="tutorials"></a>

### 1. Three-beads-per-lipid membrane: Cooke model <a name="cooke"></a>
Please add info needed to understand and run your tutorial(s).

### 2. One-particle thick fluid membrane: YLZ model <a name="ylz"></a>
Please add info needed to understand and run your tutorial(s).

### 3. Dynamically triangulated membrane model: TriLMP  <a name="trilmp"></a>
We use TriLMP to simulate a fluid membrane using a Dynamically Triangulated Network (DTN). TriLMP is a modified version of the [TriMEM](https://github.com/bio-phys/trimem) package[^Siggel2022]. To be able to run the tutorials of this section, you will have to install TriLMP. For that, please go to the [TriLMP Github repository](https://github.com/Saric-Group/trimem_sbeady) and follow the installation guide for your operating system. Once you have verified that your installation is working fine, go to [DNTSimulations](https://github.com/Saric-Group/MembraneReviewTutorials/tree/main/DNTSimulations) to run the tutorials of this section.

## Reporting bugs and feedback  <a name="bugs"></a>

Please report any bugs. Feedback on how to improve this tutorials is welcome.
